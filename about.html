    <h1>The Randomized Condorcet Voting System</h1>
    <p>
        You are about to participate in an experimentation of the Randomized
        Condorcet Voting System, a state-of-the-art electoral system that could
        reform our existing electoral systems in a very positive way.

    <h2>Why a new voting system?</h2>
    <p>
        Political shit flinging is nothing new, but it has been varying in ways
        that are cause for great concern.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/">A
                survey published by Pew Research in 2014</a> reveals that
                Americans have become more and more polarized, holding more and
                more consistently liberal or conservative opinions and having
                more and more negative opinions of the opposite side. In other
                words, nuance in people’s political opinions tends to vanish.
                In fact, many American presidents from a few decades ago would
                have looked like centrists by today’s standards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/01/political-violence-424157">An
                article published on Politico in October 2020</a> raises
                concern for the increasing share of both Democrat and
                Republican voters who think the use of political violence
                is justified.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Although there are many ways to explain these trends, one particularly
        convinced me: our electoral systems are fundamentally flawed in ways
        that incentivize these kinds of behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is difficult to be comprehensive about the many ways in which the
        different electoral systems used around the world are flawed, but some
        patterns are easy to notice:
        <ul>
            <li>
                the United States electoral system only makes two parties
                viable in the long run, which reinforces a political duopoly
                between two parties that have little incentive to actually
                serve the people who elect them;
            </li>
            <li>
                despite being more allowing of small parties, the French
                electoral system still doesn’t eliminate the high barrier
                between large and small parties, and strategical voting is
                still a matter of discussion almost every electoral cycle.
            </li>
        </ul>
        There is no reason whatsoever for political parties to be elected for
        their size rather than their ideas, and electors having to lie on their
        ballot to maximize their chances sounds like it came from a dystopian
        TV show. In the long run, it is not crazy at all to suspect these flaws
        are at least partially behind the huge social problems described above.
    </p>

    <h2>A theory of electoral systems?</h2>
    <p>
        As strange as it sounds, there does exist a theory of electoral
        systems, and in order to make it clear what a good electoral system is,
        it is important to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        An <b>election</b> is a game in the sense of game theory. It involves a
        finite number of players, called <b>electors</b>, who each make a
        <b>decision</b> by casting their ballot, and the outcome of the game
        depends on the decision of all players. To each possible outcome of the
        game is assigned a <b>utility</b> value that is subjective to each
        player and quantifies how satisfied that player is with that outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        More specifically, an election is a <b>simultaneous</b> game. This
        means that electors make their decision not knowing the other electors’
        decisions. Of course, electors may disclose whom they voted for, but:
        <ul>
            <li>they may lie;</li>
            <li>it is not intrinsic to the act of voting.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In an electoral system, all electors are provided with a finite set of
        <b>alternatives</b>, which is a more general term for candidate.
        Through their ballots, they then specify their preferences in a format
        that the electoral system allows. In a <b>uninominal</b> electoral
        system, the ballot only contains one alternative. In an <b>ordinal</b>
        electoral system, the ballot specifies a total order between the
        alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a game, players have to make decisions based on the information that
        they have. Information may be:
        <ul>
            <li><b>public:</b> available to everyone;</li>
            <li>
                <b>private:</b> known only to one player who has the discretion
                to disclose it or not (examples include what the player
                believes or wants).
            </li>
        </ul>
        A <b>strategy</b> is an algorithm that takes all the information a
        player has access to and outputs a decision. A <b>deterministic</b>
        strategy will always output the same decision given the same
        information. In particular, it doesn’t involve randomness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many technical terms describe qualities we might expect from electoral
        systems. The most interesting ones are described in the table below.
        <table>
            <tr><th>Quality</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unanimity</td>
                <td>
                    If all electors specify that <i>A</i> is their favorite
                    alternative, then <i>A</i> is necessarily elected.
                </td>
            </tr>

                    If more than half of the electors specify that <i>A</i> is
                    their favorite alternative, then <i>A</i> is necessarily
                    elected.

                    If there is a unique alternative <i>A</i> that is pairwise
                    favored over all other alternatives by over half of the
                    electors, then <i>A</i> is necessarily elected.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Independence of irrelevant alternatives</td>
                <td>
                    The probability that the electoral system favors <i>A</i>
                    over <i>B</i> cannot change by adding or removing a third,
                    unrelated alternative.

            <tr>

                    In order to maximize their expected utility, the best
                    strategy electors have is to make sure their ballot
                    truly reflects their preferences. In other words, lying on
                    the ballot is always a sub-optimal strategy.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dictatorship</td>
                <td>
                    There is a particular elector, called <b>dictator</b>,
                    whose ballot completely determines the outcome of the
                    election. The dictator may not be statically defined.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lotocracy</td>
                <td>
                    A form of dictatorship where the dictator is chosen
                    randomly. It essentially consists of picking one ballot
                    randomly and choosing the outcome from it alone.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some immediate theorems:
        <ul>
            <li>Majority implies unanimity.</li>
            <li>Condorcet criterion implies majority.</li>
            <li>Dictatorship implies unanimity.</li>
            <li>Lotocracy implies dictatorship.</li>
            <li>Lotocracy implies independence of irrelevant alternatives.</li>
            <li>Lotocracy implies strategyproofness.</li>
        </ul>
        It may seem surprising that lotocracy achieves both strategyproofness
        and independence of irrelevant alternatives so easily, but the reason
        is quite simple: relying entirely on luck closes the door to all forms
        of strategies. However, lotocracy doesn’t achieve majority. If every
        elector votes for <i>A</i> except one who votes for <i>B</i>, then
        <i>B</i> has a nonzero chance of winning. Alternatives that most
        electors are strongly against will be called <b>extreme</b> here.
    </p>

    <h2>Our electoral systems are terrible</h2>
    <p>
        The simplest voting system imaginable is the one-round uninominal
        voting system. It is the one used in the United States (Electoral
        College aside). This system trivially achieves majority. Yet, it fails
        at independence of irrelevant alternatives. In 2016, as he was running
        as an independent candidate, Bernie Sanders had to give up on his
        campaign, for all his presence would have done was taking votes away
        from Hillary Clinton. It is not unlikely that, had he not taken this
        decision, Donald Trump would have won the popular vote as well as the
        electoral one. Not only that, Bernie Sanders was incentivized to
        express unconditional support for Hillary Clinton’s platform, even
        ideas he strongly disagreed with. The slightest negative thing he would
        have said could have profited the Republican platform in some way. Not
        only had a candidate have to step back from the race, he also had to
        lie, making it two different ways he didn’t defend his ideas. This
        system also fails at strategyproofness in that small parties have very
        little chance of winning the election. As a result, supporters of small
        parties have to consider voting from “the least of two evils” and thus
        lie on their ballot. This has the effect of feeding a party duopoly
        that removes all incentive on the parties to serve the people, since
        the barrier to entry of competing smaller parties is humongous.
    </p>
    <p>
        In France, the electoral system used is also uninominal, but it has two
        rounds so that the leading two parties of the first round face off in
        the second one. If a party has the majority in the first round, then it
        immediately wins, so this system achieves majority. However, it fails
        at independence of irrelevant alternatives for the same reason as
        before. Although there is no party duopoly, strategyproofness is still
        an issue because if a party you hate is likely to pass the first round,
        then it may be worth it not to vote for your party in favor of another
        one that would be more likely to win in the second round. This becomes
        more evident as the competition between second and third parties is
        tight. In 2012,
        <a href="https://fr.wikinews.org/wiki/%C3%89lection_pr%C3%A9sidentielle_fran%C3%A7aise_de_2012_:_Fran%C3%A7ois_Bayrou_vainqueur_au_second_tour_%3F">unofficial
        statistics</a> proved that centrist candidate François Bayrou would
        have beaten François Hollande in a face-off, yet he did not pass the
        first round. This system elected a candidate that the people would
        gladly replace by someone else if they had the opportunity. If fact,
        <a href="https://images.math.cnrs.fr/Et-le-vainqueur-du-second-tour-est.html?lang=fr">this
        article by Rémi Peyre</a> explains that François Bayrou would have
        beaten any other candidate. Thus, this system fails at the Condorcet
        criterion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Condorcet criterion is actually very important. Imagine that the
        day after the election, a referendum is held to replace the winning
        candidate with François Bayrou. No matter who that candidate may have
        been, the people would approve the proposition. There is evidently some
        kind of unstability that the electoral system did not take into
        account, and this led a blatantly sub-optimal candidate into office.
        In fact, the winner of the election, François Hollande, finished his
        term with an
        <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/hrrywlepkk/Results%20for%20Huffington%20Post%20(Barom%C3%A8tre)%20057%20270417_%20As_Sent.pdf">approval
        rate of 17%</a> and is, as of 2020, the only French president who
        didn’t bother running for reelection since at least 1958.
    </p>

    <h2>What about these alternatives?</h2>
    <p>
        Several alternatives are frequently proposed to the usual electoral
        systems. This section will explain their typical flaws.
    </p>

    <h3>Instant-runoff voting</h3>
    <p>
        This is an ordinal system where the electors’ first choices are used in
        a uninominal fashion. If a candidate has the majority, they win.
        Otherwise, the last candidate is eliminated, and another uninominal
        election is simulated with the remaining candidates until someone has
        the majority. Although this system is quite robust, it still provably
        fails at strategyproofness. Tactical voting would consist of choosing
        the order of eliminations wisely.
    </p>

    <h3>Score voting</h3>
    <p>
        The idea of this system is that you give each candidate a score, and
        the candidate with the best total score wins. In reality, the optimal
        strategy in this system is to give your favorite candidate the maximum
        score and zero to everyone else. We fall back to a uninominal electoral
        system.
    </p>

    <h3>Borda count</h3>
    <p>
        In this ordinal system, electors give each candidate <i>n</i> −
        <i>k</i> − 1 points where <i>k</i> refers to the rank of that candidate
        on the ballot. In this way, the top-ranked candidate gets <i>n</i> − 1
        points while the last one gets zero. A variant starts at 1 instead of
        0. The problem is that if your favorite candidate <i>A</i> is likely to
        lose against a candidate <i>B</i>, it may be viable to insincerely put
        <i>B</i> at the bottom of your ballot. The Borda count thus fails at
        strategyproofness.
    </p>

    <h3>Majority judgement</h3>
    <p>
        This one is actually not too bad. It consists of giving appreciations
        to candidates (<i>e.g.</i> very good, good, mixed, bad, very bad). If
        a candidate has the best median appreciation, they win. Otherwise,
        there are several ways to break ties.
    </p>

    <h2>The two impossibility theorems</h2>
    <p>
        As it turns out, two theorems seriously get in the way of having ideal
        electoral systems.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Arrow’s impossibility theorem:</b>
                No ordinal electoral system can achieve both unanimity and
                independence of irrelevant alternatives without being a
                dictatorship.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Gibbard’s theorem:</b>
                No electoral system can achieve strategyproofness for more than
                two alternatives without being a dictatorship.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Although Arrow’s theorem can be worked around by using non-ordinal
        electoral systems, Gibbard’s theorem applies to all electoral systems.
        It is therefore pointless to look for perfect electoral systems.
        Instead, the hunt should go toward systems that are too unpredictable
        to willingly manipulate in a particular direction.
    </p>

    <h2>The Randomized Condorcet Voting System</h2>
    <p>
        This last section details the electoral system that convinced me the
        most. It’s biggest strengths are that it is provably strategyproof in
        some cases and that it is made difficult to predict in other cases due
        to randomness.
    </p>

    <h3>The Condorcet method</h3>
    <p>
        The Condorcet method was an unsuccessful attempt by Nicolas de
        Condorcet at making the most natural electoral system that would
        achieve the Condorcet criterion. Although it initially failed, recent
        advances in game theory allowed to generalize it in a way that makes it
        a lot more useful.
    </p>

    <h4>Ballots</h4>
    <p>
        There are several ways ballots can be formed, but the idea is to
        organize duels between alternatives. In the most general form, the
        ballot is a grid where rows and columns are alternatives and the
        elector has to specify who is better on each square. Of course, this
        first approach is very wrong, but we can improve upon it. We call the
        <b>complexity</b> of a ballot the maximum amount of information the
        elector has to specify to fill it as a function of the number of
        alternatives <i>n</i>. It is not equal to the total number of valid
        ballots. This first grid ballot has a complexity of
        <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first improvement comes from the fact that one cannot prefer an
        alternative over itself. This property is known as
        <b>irreflexivity</b>. This excludes the diagonal in the grid. The
        complexity falls down to <i>n</i> (<i>n</i> − 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The second improvement comes from the fact that from two alternatives
        <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, one cannot simultaneously prefer <i>A</i> over
        <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> over <i>A</i>. This property is known as
        <b>antisymmetry</b>. This cuts the grid in half. The complexity falls
        down to <i>n</i> (<i>n</i> − 1) ÷ 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last improvement comes from the fact that if, from three
        alternatives <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, a same elector prefers
        <i>A</i> over <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> over <i>C</i>, then they prefer
        <i>A</i> over <i>C</i>. This property is known as <b>transitivity</b>
        and is one of the Von Neumann−Morgenstern axioms for rational behavior.
        Intuitively it may be possible to still prefer <i>C</i> over <i>A</i>,
        but the cyclical preferences that this entails are irrational and may
        be exploited for scams. A grid is no longer suited for this type of
        ballot. Instead, we will use ranges of ranks. The elector gives each
        alternative a range [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>] of ranks. If the ranges of
        two alternatives overlap, they are considered equal, otherwise the one
        with greater ranges is considered better. This makes the complexity
        drop down to 2 <i>n</i> which scales a lot better than the previous
        ones. It is also still intuitive and leaves room for leaving
        alternatives unranked.
    </p>

    <h4>Condorcet winners</h4>
    <p>
        The goal of the Condorcet method is to find a <b>Condorcet winner</b>,
        that is an alternative that either ties or wins against all other ones.
        Conceptually, a directed graph called a <b>duel graph</b> represents
        all duels in the following way:
        <ul>
            <li>
                the vertices correspond to alternatives;
            </li>
            <li>
                between two alternatives <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, if more
                electors prefer <i>A</i> over <i>B</i> than the opposite, then
                the duel graph contains an arrow from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>;
            </li>
            <li>
                alternatives that tie have no arrow between them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        On such a graph, a Condorcet winner is given by a vertex that has no
        incoming arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, the Condorcet winner is not always unique, nor does it
        always exist. Imagine an election between three alternatives <i>A</i>,
        <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> where a third of electors prefer <i>A</i> over
        <i>B</i> over <i>C</i>, a third prefer <i>B</i> over <i>C</i> over
        <i>A</i>, and a third prefer <i>C</i> over <i>A</i> over <i>B</i>. The
        resulting duel graph is cyclical although the individual preferences
        weren’t. It also has no Condorcet winner. This particular situation is
        commonly called the <b>Condorcet paradox</b> and was the major reason
        why the Condorcet method originally failed: even in the absence of ties
        between two alternatives, the Condorcet method as originally designed
        can fail at electing a winner.

    <h3>The gold nugget of randomization</h3>
    <p>
        Fortunately, mathematics made huge progress since Condorcet’s days.
        The cyclical graph in the Condorcet paradox should remind you of
        something: it is equivalent to the graph explaining the rules of
        rock paper scissors. Now think outside the box: how do you win at
        rock paper scissors? Sure, there are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#Strategies">strategies
        based on human player biases</a>, but ultimately, no strategy can do
        better than a player who plays completely randomly. We will apply
        similar principles to decide an optimal strategy on a generalized
        rock paper scissors game based on our duel graph and deduce a
        probability distribution from which to choose the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Formally, by generalized rock paper scissors game, we mean any
        2-player, zero-sum, simultaneous game whose outcomes are either a tie
        or a win−lose with the same utility payoffs in all win−lose outcomes.
        A <b>zero-sum</b> game means that the total utility gained by the
        winners is always equal to the total utility lost by the losers. The
        other terms are either defined above or self-explanatory. Then, we
        define <b>mixed strategies</b> as strategies that choose a decision
        randomly, not necessarily according to a uniform probability
        distribution. Through mathematical wizardry that is beyond the scope
        of this text, it is possible to show that maximizing one’s expected
        payoff is equivalent to solving a certain
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear
        program</a> which can be done with the simplex algorithm or any other
        linear solver.

    <p>
        All of this work results in the Randomized Condorcet Voting System
        (RCVS). It may be difficult to understand all the mathematics behind
        it, but the next section will detail why its use is more than worth it.
    </p>

    <h3>So how good is it?</h3>
    <p>
        Now to examine the theoretical properties of the RCVS.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Condorcet criterion:</b>
                Being a generalization of the Condorcet method, the RCVS
                trivially achieves the Condorcet criterion. Then, it also
                achieves majority and unanimity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Independence of irrelevant alternatives:</b>
                Since the ballots are not total orders, the RCVS is not subject
                to Arrow’s impossibility theorem. In 1997, Jean-François
                Laslier
                <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642645617">proved</a>
                that if an alternative is outside the domain of the election’s
                optimal strategy, then removing it will not change the optimal
                strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Strategyproofness:</b>
                Gibbard’s theorem states that this property is unreachable in
                general cases, but it doesn’t rule out getting close to it.
                All Condorcet methods are strategyproof in the special case
                where more than half the electors have the same favorite
                alternative. The RCVS also achieves strategyproofness in the
                slightly more general case where a unique Condorcet winner
                exists (the difference is subtle, but you can picture some
                electors each preferring a different irrelevant candidate over
                <i>A</i> and agregate it in a way that <i>A</i> is still a
                Condorcet winner). Lê Nguyên Hoang
                <a href="http://www.science4all.org/wp-content/uploads/RandomizedCondorcet.pdf">proved</a>
                that this property is very rare in the sense that any electoral
                system that achieves this property will behave the same as the
                RCVS in many cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Extreme-proofness:</b>
                The RCVS will never elect an extreme alternative, meaning an
                alternative that a majority of electors are strongly against.
                This is a very good property whose lack was the best argument
                against lotocracy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What about the Electoral College?</h3>
    <p>
        Although the RCVS isn’t incompatible with an Electoral College, as far
        as I know, there is currently no theoretical inquiry on what properties
        could be achieved with it. Personally, I did implement features in my
        code that could be used to simulate an Electoral College, but I would
        advise against its use until that work is done.
